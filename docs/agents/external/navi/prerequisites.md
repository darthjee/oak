# Prerequisites

## Navi configuration file

Both options require a YAML configuration file that tells Navi which URLs to warm.
Create a file (e.g. `navi_config.yml`) with at least a `clients` and a `resources` section.
**Omit the `web:` key** to run Navi in headless mode (no web server), which is the right choice for CI pipelines.

```yaml
workers:
  quantity: 5          # number of concurrent workers (default: 1)
  retry_cooldown: 2000 # ms before a failed job is retried (default: 2000)
  sleep: 500           # ms the engine waits between allocation ticks (default: 500)
  max-retries: 3       # max retries before a job is marked dead (default: 3)

log:
  size: 100            # max number of log entries kept in memory (default: 100)

failure:
  threshold: 10.0      # optional: exit with failure if > 10% of jobs are dead

clients:
  default:
    base_url: https://your-app.example.com
    timeout: 5000      # ms before the request times out (default: 5000)
  auth_api:
    base_url: https://api.your-app.example.com
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN

resources:
  home:
    - url: /           # HTML page — fetches linked JS and CSS assets
      status: 200
      assets:
        - selector: 'link[rel="stylesheet"]'   # matches <link rel="stylesheet" href="...">
          attribute: href
        - selector: 'script[src]'              # matches <script src="...">
          attribute: src
  products:
    - url: /products.json
      status: 200
      actions:
        - resource: product_detail
          parameters:
            id: parsedBody.id   # extract "id" from each response item
    - url: /products         # redirect — Navi validates the 302 status
      status: 302
      disabled: true         # temporarily skip this entry without deleting it
    - url: /#/products       # hash-based SPA route — same HTML template as home
      status: 200
  product_detail:
    - url: /products/{:id}.json
      status: 200
      client: auth_api   # use a specific named client for this request
```

Key points:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `workers.quantity` | Number of parallel workers. Defaults to `1`. |
| `workers.retry_cooldown` | Milliseconds a failed job waits before being re-queued for retry. Defaults to `2000`. |
| `workers.sleep` | Milliseconds the engine waits between allocation ticks. Defaults to `500`. |
| `workers.max-retries` | Maximum number of times a job is retried before being moved to the dead queue. Defaults to `3`. |
| `log.size` | Maximum number of log entries kept in the in-memory log buffer. Defaults to `100`. |
| `failure.threshold` | Optional. Percentage (0–100) of dead jobs that triggers a non-zero exit code. When absent, Navi always exits successfully. |
| `clients.<name>.base_url` | Base URL prepended to every resource URL. Supports `$VAR` / `${VAR}` environment variable references. |
| `clients.<name>.timeout` | Optional request timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to `5000`. |
| `clients.<name>.headers` | Optional headers sent with every request. Values support `$VAR` / `${VAR}` environment variable references. |
| `resources.<name>` | A named group of URLs to warm. |
| `url` | URL path appended to `base_url`. Supports `{:placeholder}` tokens. |
| `status` | Expected HTTP status code. Requests returning a different code are retried. |
| `client` | Name of the client to use for this request. Defaults to `default`. |
| `enabled` | Optional. Set to `false` to mark this request disabled. Defaults to `true`. |
| `disabled` | Optional. Set to `true` to mark this request disabled — always wins over `enabled`. Defaults to `false`. A disabled request is never enqueued (not at startup, not on manual/API trigger, and not when targeted by another resource's `actions`/`paginated_actions`). |
| `max_page` | Optional. When this request is the target of another resource's `paginated_actions`, caps how many of its pages ever get enqueued — a ceiling owned by this resource, applying uniformly to every caller. Counts pages, not page numbers (the first `max_page` pages in iteration order, whether `zero_indexed` or not). Omitted, `null`, `0`, or any other non-positive-integer value means unlimited; a present-but-invalid value also logs a warning. Defaults to unlimited. |
| `actions[].resource` | Resource to enqueue after a successful response (resource chaining). |
| `actions[].parameters` | Path expressions that extract values from the response (e.g. `parsedBody.id`, `headers['x-next-page']`). |
| `paginated_actions` | Optional. Like `actions`, but fans out one request per page instead of one per array item. |
| `paginated_actions[].resource` | Resource to enqueue for each page. Required. |
| `paginated_actions[].pagination` | List of pagination config entries. Required. |
| `paginated_actions[].pagination[].pages` | Path expression resolving to the total page count (e.g. `parsedBody.pagination.pages`). |
| `paginated_actions[].pagination[].page_key` | Parameter name injected as the page number into each downstream request URL. |
| `paginated_actions[].pagination[].zero_indexed` | Boolean. Pages start at `0` when `true`, at `1` when `false` (default). |
| `paginated_actions[].parameters` | Optional. Path expressions (same syntax as `actions[].parameters`) resolved against the response and merged into each page's request parameters. `page_key`'s value always takes precedence on key collision. |
| `assets[].selector` | CSS selector used to find elements in an HTML response body. |
| `assets[].attribute` | Attribute name on matched elements that holds the asset URL (e.g. `href`, `src`). |
| `assets[].client` | Optional named client to use when fetching each discovered asset. Defaults to `default`. |
| `assets[].status` | Expected HTTP status for asset fetches. Defaults to `200`. |
| `parser` | Optional. Extracts structured items from the raw response body after a successful response, independently of (in parallel with) the resource's own `actions`/`paginated_actions` chaining. **Required** for any extraction or emission to happen — with no `parser`, nothing is extracted and an `emit` block does nothing. See [Extraction Configuration](extraction-configuration.md). |
| `parser.type` | One of `regex`, `json_path`, `css`. Selects the extraction strategy. Required. |
| `parser.match` | Meaning depends on `type`: a regex pattern (`regex`), a dot-notation path to the array to extract items from, e.g. `data.items` (`json_path`), or a CSS selector for the repeated container elements (`css`). Required for `regex` and `css`. Optional for `json_path`: omitting `match` (aliases `match: ''` / `match: '.'`) treats the whole parsed response body as the array of items, with no path navigation. |
| `parser.filter` | Optional, `json_path`/`css` only. List of AND'ed conditions a matched item/container must satisfy to be included (`{ field, equals }` / `{ field, equals_field }` for `json_path`; `{ selector, attribute, trim, equals }` / `{ ..., equals_field: {...} }` for `css`). |
| `parser.fields` | Field-mapping map. `json_path`: a `{ sourceKey: outputKey }` map remapping the matched item's keys. `css`: a `{ outputKey: { selector, attribute, array, trim } }` map, each field resolved relative to the matched container. |
| `parser.field` | Single output key name. `regex`: required, holds the captured value. `css`: fallback single-field mode's output key, used when `fields` is absent. |
| `parser.attribute` | `css` fallback single-field mode only (used when `fields` is absent). Attribute to read off the matched container; reads text content when absent. |
| `parser.trim` | `css` fallback single-field mode only (used when `fields` is absent). Whether to trim the resolved value. Defaults to `true`. |
| `emit` | Optional. Sends each item extracted by `parser` to an external endpoint, one request per item. Does nothing without a `parser` block. See [Emit Configuration](emit-configuration.md). |
| `emit.size` | Optional **top-level** key (a sibling of `resources`/`web`/`log`, not part of a resource's `emit` block). Sizes the in-memory ring buffer behind `GET /emissions.json`. Defaults to `100`. |
| `extraction.size` | Optional **top-level** key, sibling of `emit.size`. Sizes the in-memory ring buffer behind `GET /extractions.json`. Defaults to `100`. |

See [Extraction Configuration](extraction-configuration.md) and [Emit Configuration](emit-configuration.md) for the full field-by-field breakdown of `parser` and `emit`. This is a separate mechanism from the `actions[].parameters` path expressions (`parsedBody.*`) described below — the two run in parallel after a successful response.

> **`parsedBody` is camelCase — never `parsed_body`.**
> Path expressions in `actions[].parameters` values must use `parsedBody.<field>` (camelCase).
> Writing `parsed_body.<field>` (snake_case) is silently unrecognised and throws a
> `MissingMappingVariable` error at runtime, breaking every chained request.
>
> Valid namespaces for path expressions:
>
> | Namespace | Example | Resolves to |
> |-----------|---------|-------------|
> | `parsedBody` | `parsedBody.id` | field `id` in the parsed JSON response body |
> | `headers` | `headers['x-next-page']` | HTTP response header value |
> | `parameters` | `parameters.category_id` | parameter inherited from the parent chain |
>
> **Note:** HTTP response header names are always lowercase after Node.js normalization. Use lowercase keys in path expressions (e.g. `headers['x-total-pages']`), regardless of how the server set them.
