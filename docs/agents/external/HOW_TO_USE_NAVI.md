# How to Use Navi

[Navi](https://github.com/darthjee/navi) is a queue-based cache-warmer written in Node.js.
It reads a YAML configuration file and performs HTTP requests concurrently using a configurable worker pool, with support for resource chaining and automatic retry of failed requests.

This guide is intended for developers and AI agents who want to integrate Navi as a cache-warmer into their own projects or CI/CD pipelines.
Two integration modes are covered:

- **Option A** — use the `darthjee/navi-hey` Docker image directly in a CI step.
- **Option B** — install the `navi-hey` npm package in a Node.js-capable CI image and run it from the command line.
- **Option C** — use `darthjee/navi-hey:latest` as the CircleCI executor image (simplest for CircleCI).
